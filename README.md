# vim-slack-format

[Slack][] formatting in Vim

## What it provides?

This plugin provides syntax highlighting for the [Slack Format][] inside of Vim
and provides the `.slack` file type.

## Installation

If you don't have a preferred installation method, I recommend installing
[pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) and using it in
combination with [git
submodules](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Tools-Submodules) as describe in this
[Vimcast - Synchronizing plugins with git submodules and
pathogen](http://vimcasts.org/episodes/synchronizing-plugins-with-git-submodules-and-pathogen/).

If your installation method is the above recommended one, it should be as simple
as running the following commands:

```text
cd ~/.vim/
git submodule add git@github.com:uptech/vim-slack-format.git bundle/vim-slack-format
git add .
git commit -m "Added vim-slack-format plugin to my setup."
```

If you are using another method, you are on your own. I have been told that this
plugin is compatible with [Vundle](http://github.com/gmarik/vundle) though I
have not tested it myself.
