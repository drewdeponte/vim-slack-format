# vim-slack-format

[Slack][] formatting in Vim

## What it provides?

This plugin provides syntax highlighting for the [Slack Format][] inside of Vim
and provides the `.slack` file type.

## Installation

The following is the recommended approach using the vim8's built in package
management. If you aren't using vim8 then upgrade to get the latest goodness.

```text
cd ~/.vim/
git submodule add https://github.com/uptech/vim-slack-format.git pack/bundle/start/vim-slack-format
git add .
git commit -m "Added vim-slack-format plugin to my setup."
```

If you are using another method, you are on your own.
